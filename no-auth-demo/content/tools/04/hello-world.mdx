### Due to some Kingdom requirements on Pre-registration, NO money will be accepted prior to the event. HOWEVER, do not let that deter you from pre-registering for the event! You can still reserve space for you and yours like always, just fill out the form, send it in like always, and pay at the gate! Easy-peasy!

The Uprising XXXII pre-reg form is here: `Uprising32Pre-Registration Form`

Merchants! If you would like space to sell your wares, know that there are no fees at Uprising 33. Just Pre-Register, fill-out the merchant packet, and return it. You may download the merchant forms here: Uprising 2019 Merchant Packet

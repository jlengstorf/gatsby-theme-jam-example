## The Heart of Artemisia

Let it be known throughout the land that there will be an Uprising War in the Barony of 1000 Eyes June 12th through June 16th, 2019. There will be fighting in all forms â€“ heavy, rapier, archery and thrown weapons. Exhibitions of skill, tournaments and competitions to delight the eyes and hearts of the populace both young and old alike will be held for your enjoyment. Merchants aplenty will be displaying their wonderful goods for the satisfaction of your shopping desires. For the intellectual, there will be classes with teachers sharing their expertise and knowledge for those wishing to expand their knowledge of the mind and soul. The nights will be filled with the sounds of music and drums and a joyous noise will be heard by all as we sit around the campfires and celebrate 32 years of Uprising Tradition!

Pets are allowed but must be leashed at all times and we ask that you clean up after them.

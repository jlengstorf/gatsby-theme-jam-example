### Merchanting at Uprising 33

Greetings! The Barony of 1000 Eyes is so happy that you are joining us as a merchant at Uprising War XXXII. Merchants bring so much to an event. Along with their wares they bestow to our event entertainment, ambiance, education, and much, much more for event participants. I am looking forward to welcoming you to our event and working with you. If there is anything I can do to answer questions, address concerns, or make your experience better, please let me know.

Respectfully,
Sheelaegh mac Cathail
